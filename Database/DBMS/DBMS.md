# DBMS (Database Managment System)
1. Abstract Data Type (ADT):

A DBMS must have 4 operations.

        1)Insert
        2)Update
        3)Delete
        4)Query
        
2. Integrity:

        1)Domain Integrity (DI):
        
        Constraint the domain of a data.
        
        The value of input must be in the range of the domain.
        
        2) Entity Integrity (EI):
        
         The primary key can NOT be set to null.
         
         Other field than primary key may be set to null.
        
        3) Reference Integrity (RI):

                A referential integrity constraint is specified between two tables.
                In the Referential integrity constraints, if a foreign key in Table 1 refers to the Primary Key of Table 2, 
                then every value of the Foreign Key in Table 1 must be null or be available in Table 2.
