# Concept of Database
## Design a database
### Step 1: ERM 
Create ERM then check.

To create an ERD, one has to

1. identify entities.
2. identify relationships between these entities.
3. identify attributes of entities.
4. determine attributes domains of entities.
   
### Step 2: ERM to Tables
Map ERM to tables and check.

To map ERM to tables, one has to
1. Map tables.
2. Check table structures using normalization.
3. Check table support user transactions.
4. Check business rules.
5. Review logical database design with users.
6. Build global logical data model.
7. Check it.

### Step 3: Translate logical database design for target DBMS.

1. Design base tables.
2. Design representation of derived data.
3. Design remaining business rules. (The rules that we don't mentioned above.)

### Step 4: FIle organization index
1. Choose file organization.
2. Create its index.
3. Check and verify them.

### Step 5: user view
1. Design user view

### Step 6: security mechanisms
1. Design security measures for database implementation.
2. Document it.
